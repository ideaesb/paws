 * The purpose of this class is to determine from the request 
 * what the kind of list is being rendered and to populate the message 
 * header of list.jsp accordingly.  It does not need to actually generate 
 * the project list since that may be more elegant to generate it as a javabean
 * (ListBean.java) directly from project parameters.  Although 
 * this would also be a good place to "unify" the message header as well as the 
 * project list. We will see how it goes...just stubbing out for the moment.
